# k6-load-concurrency-suite

P6 of the QA portfolio: load, concurrency and performance tests with [k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/)
against self-hosted products started by
[qa-portfolio-harness](https://github.com/Jayami123/qa-portfolio-harness) `v0.2.11`.

Phase 0 proves the harness and k6 smoke. Phase 1 Task 1 adds the Playwright race framework
(API-only, no browser) and an unmapped Medusa self-test against `GET /health` plus a read-only
Postgres oracle.

## Run the smoke check locally

Needs Node 22.22+, Docker, pnpm 10.11.1 and k6.

```bash
npm ci
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh medusa   # clones the Medusa fork into ../products if it is missing
npm run up:medusa
npm run smoke:medusa
npm run down:medusa
```

`npm run check` runs Prettier, the TypeScript check, `k6 inspect` (skipped when k6 is missing),
and unit tests (`npm run test:unit`).

## Run a race locally

Needs Medusa up (same as the smoke check). Use Node 22.23+ on PATH (see AGENTS.md).

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
npm run test:unit
npm run up:medusa
RACE_TRIALS=3 npm run race:medusa
npm run down:medusa
```

The self-test writes `results/races/framework-self-test.json` (gitignored). Playwright race
projects use `retries: 0` and `workers: 1`; concurrency is inside the test via `fireTogether`.

CI runs this self-test (`RACE_TRIALS=3`) in the `medusa-smoke` job on every PR and uploads
`results/races/` as the `race-histograms-medusa` artifact.

`dispatchSpreadMs` is how far apart Node started the requests (max start minus min start, in ms).
It is not the time at which the server received them. A small spread means the client released
the burst together.

- `/health` not HTTP 200 with body `OK` → **PRODUCT BUG** (paste status and body).
- Spread ≥ `RACE_MAX_SPREAD_MS` (default 5) with successful responses → **TEST BUG** (barrier
  ran sequentially or was not a gate). Raise the env var on noisy CI runners; do not change the
  helper.
- Mapped race case IDs (for example Medusa oversell) start in Phase 1 Task 2.

## Rule for numbers

Published performance numbers come only from CI runs (GitHub Actions or a dedicated machine),
reported as the median of at least 3 runs. Local and cloud-agent runs only prove a test works.

The master plan is in [docs/master-plan.html](docs/master-plan.html).
